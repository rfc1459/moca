        "q": "Is the camp really free or is there a catch?",
        "a": "The camp is totally free. Just to face the expenses, some Olographic (easily recognizable, don't worry) will ask you a voluntary subscription at the entry. Then, it will depend only on your kindness."

      },
      {
        "q": "Is the subscription required or can I just skip it?",
