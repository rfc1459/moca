The purpose of the association is to disseminate a culture of telematics other than the one proposed by the market imperatives, but which is as close as possible to the one of the pioneers of BBSs. Obviously without rejecting the means now available, Metro Olografix wants to recreate the spirit, charm, wonder and sense of freedom of the first experiments."
